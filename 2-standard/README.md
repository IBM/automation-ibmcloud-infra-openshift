# IBM Cloud Reference Architecture - Automation

> This collection of IBM Cloud terraform automation bundles has been crafted from a set of [Terraform modules](https://modules.cloudnativetoolkit.dev/) created by the IBM Ecosystem Labs team part of the [IBM Ecosystem organization](https://www.ibm.com/partnerworld/public?mhsrc=ibmsearch_a&mhq=partnerworld). Please contact **Matthew Perrins** __mjperrin@us.ibm.com__, **Sean Sundberg** __seansund@us.ibm.com__, or **Andrew Trice** __amtrice@us.ibm.com__ for more details or raise an issue on the [repository](https://github.com/cloud-native-toolkit/software-everywhere) for bugs or feature requests.

Three different flavors of the reference architecture are provided with different levels of complexity.

- QuickStart - minimum to get OpenShift with public endpoints running on basic VPC + Subnet with ROKS
- Standard - a simple robust architecture that can support a production workload in a single VPC with a VPN+Private Endpoints and a ROKS cluster
- Advanced - a sophisticated architecture isolating DMZs, Development and Production VPCs for best practices
